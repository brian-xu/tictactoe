# Simulating game spaces with backtracking

Efficiently simulates all tic-tac-toe boards to generate a complete minimax representation.

By using a backtracking algorithm to iterate through all possible game states, we can generate the entire game tree for Tic-Tac-Toe. Using this data, it is possible to create a minimax representation that will always make the optimal move.

## How-to

1. Run `solve.py`.
2. Run `tictactoe.py`.
